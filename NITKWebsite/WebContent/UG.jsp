                    <p>The B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering is one of the most popular programmes at N.I.T.K
                        Surathkal. The programme was stated in 1986 and has been designed to cater to global demands and
                        offers a balanced coverage of hardware and software systems. The programme includes elective
                        courses covering thrust areas such as Distributed Systems & Computing, Parallel Architectures &
                        High performance computing, High-Speed Networks, Designing with Network Processors, Security and
                        Embedded Systems Cloud Computing etc. The B.Tech. programme enjoys an enviable placement of
                        almost 100% year after year. About 25 to 35% of the students pursue higher studies after their
                        graduation, mostly in U.S with scholarship and even without fellowship. </p>
